# INTRO
Hi! I am Jenuel Ganawed, I made this template so that If i have new projects in the future. It will Be easy to Setup a Project. I make my own templates, for easy project setup and ready auth for user login and logout.

> You can check more in my Project Template Repo in https://github.com/organizations/bro-jenuel-project-templates/settings/profile

For This Project This are the tools/things That I included.
- ***vue 3***
  - This is the frontend.
- ***naive-ui***
  - This is for component. I choose this because it is really great component libraries. It has a lot of components available and is being supported.
- ***WindiCSS***
  - I chose this over tailwind because I feel like WindiCSS is a lot faster and has more features than tailwind css
- ***sass/scss***
  - i like using scss or sass, its is more easier and faster when styling.

> **Recommendation:**
> - I Recommend that you use `yarn`, I believe its a lot better than `npm`.
> - User only this template when creating admin dashboards like CRM etc. Because this setup is for single page application. `BUT` you can still use this for `SSR` by using the web routes and laravels `views`, you only need to setup the route for the single page app, and the SSR app. So that routes will not collide with each other.

#### Project Setup
Run `yarn setup`. This command will automatically install all the dependencies that you needed.

#### Serve Project in Development
Run `yarn serve`. This will serve the web app on your development mode.


#### To Build the Front End
Run `yarn build` This will build the frontend app to add it in the laravels public folder so that it can be easily accessed.
